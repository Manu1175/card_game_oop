# card_game_oop
My first solo OO project

## Description
We want you to build a basis for a card game. There is not an actual game being played in the must-have version. There are no points that get counted. What we want is just that a deck of cards gets created, and split between the different players and each player plays a card at every turn, until there are no cards left.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
 ```sh
   git clone [https://github.com/Manu1175/card_game_oop.git]
   cd card_game_oop
   ```
2. **Run with Python 3:**
   ```python main.py```


---
## Usage
The program will prepare a deck, distribute to the players, show cards per player untill game is over.
